After finishing this product:

- I has use my knowledge and success in buiding a functionality website with with necessary features. Day by day, continuously adding new features sharpens my skills and makes me more fluent.

- Beside the advance, i made this website with no experience of real project ( I'm also looking for an internship position for the September 2024 semester :3 ), so my code is still dirty as it alway be. So i hope that with this project, the company i applied for internship, will give me a chance to my skill and knowledge.

writing this readme file in exact October,2 tuesday 2024. I'm really excited and looking forward to finding a intership position
